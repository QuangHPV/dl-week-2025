# Browser Extension for AI Content Detection and Fact-Checking

## Overview

This Chrome extension serves as the frontend interface for our AI Content Detection and Fact-Checking System. It allows users to interact with the backend API directly from their browser, providing a seamless experience for analyzing text and images while browsing the web.

## Features

### Text Analysis

- **AI-Generated Text Detection**: Analyze selected text to determine if it was likely generated by an AI system.
- **Fact-Checking**: Verify the factual accuracy of selected statements against reliable sources.
- **Floating Widget**: A non-intrusive magnifying glass icon appears when text is selected, providing quick access to analysis tools.
- **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click options for analyzing selected text.

### Image Analysis

- **Deepfake Detection**: Right-click on images to analyze them for potential manipulation or AI generation.

### User Interface

- **Overlay Results**: Analysis results appear in an overlay window, allowing users to view results without leaving the current page.
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during analysis operations.
- **Clean Design**: Minimal, non-intrusive UI elements that don't interfere with normal browsing.

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **manifest.json**: Extension configuration and permissions.
- **background.js**: Background service worker that handles context menu creation and API communication.
- **Content.js**: Content script that injects UI elements and handles user interactions on web pages.
- **styles.css**: Styling for the extension's UI elements.

### How It Works

1. **Text Selection Detection**: The extension monitors text selection events on web pages.
2. **UI Injection**: When text is selected, a floating widget is injected near the selection.
3. **User Interaction**: Users can click the widget or use context menu options to trigger analysis.
4. **API Communication**: The extension sends the selected content to the backend API for analysis.
5. **Result Display**: Analysis results are displayed in an overlay window on the current page.

## Installation

### Development Mode

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dl-week-2025
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` directory from the project

5. The extension should now be installed and visible in your browser toolbar

### Prerequisites

- The backend FastAPI server must be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` for the extension to function properly.
- Make sure to follow the setup instructions in the main README.md to set up the backend server.

## Usage

### Analyzing Text

1. Select text on any webpage by highlighting it with your mouse.

2. Either:

   - Click on the magnifying glass icon that appears near the selection and choose an analysis option, or
   - Right-click on the selected text and choose "Detect misinformed text" or "Fact check information" from the context menu.

3. Wait for the analysis to complete (a loading indicator will be displayed).

4. View the results in the overlay window that appears.

### Analyzing Images

1. Right-click on any image on a webpage.

2. Select "Detect deepfake" from the context menu.

3. Wait for the analysis to complete.

4. View the results in the overlay window that appears.

## Design Decisions

### Non-Intrusive UI

We designed the extension to be as non-intrusive as possible, with a minimal UI that appears only when needed and doesn't interfere with normal browsing. The floating widget and overlay windows are designed to be easily dismissible.

### Context Menu Integration

Context menu integration provides a familiar interface for users who are accustomed to right-clicking for additional options. This makes the extension more intuitive and easier to discover.

### Real-Time Analysis

The extension performs analysis in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users. This allows for a seamless experience where users can quickly verify information as they browse.

## Browser Compatibility

This extension is designed for Chromium-based browsers, including:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave
- Opera

## Future Improvements

- Add support for Firefox and Safari
- Implement a history feature to track previous analyses
- Add customizable settings for UI appearance and behavior
- Implement batch analysis for multiple selections
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Develop a popup UI for the extension icon with additional features
