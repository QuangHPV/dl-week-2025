# AI Content Detection and Fact-Checking System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for detecting AI-generated content and fact-checking information on the web. It consists of two main components:

1. **FastAPI Backend**: A robust API service that provides endpoints for AI-generated text detection, fact-checking, and deepfake image detection.
2. **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension that allows users to interact with the backend directly from their browser, analyzing selected text and images.

The system is designed to help users identify potentially misleading or AI-generated content while browsing the web, providing an additional layer of verification in an era of increasing synthetic media and misinformation.

### Backend Components

The FastAPI backend is organized into several modules:

- **AI-Generated Text Detection**: Uses a RoBERTa-based model to identify text likely generated by AI systems.
- **Fact-Checking**: Leverages search engines and LLMs to verify factual claims against reliable sources.
- **Deepfake Detection**: Employs multiple models to identify manipulated images and videos.

### Extension Components

The browser extension provides a user-friendly interface:

- **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click options for analyzing selected text or images.
- **Floating Widget**: Appears when text is selected, offering analysis options.
- **Results Display**: Shows analysis results in an overlay without leaving the current page.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **FastAPI**: High-performance Python web framework for building APIs
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for state-of-the-art NLP models
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **YOLO**: Object detection for identifying people in images
- **Roboflow**: Cloud-based computer vision platform
- **DIRE & DFDC Models**: Specialized deepfake detection models

### Frontend (Extension)

- **Chrome Extension API**: For browser integration
- **JavaScript**: For extension functionality
- **CSS**: For styling the extension UI

## Why This Approach?

### Multi-Model Ensemble for Deepfake Detection

We implemented multiple deepfake detection models (Roboflow, DIRE, and DFDC) and ensemble their predictions to improve accuracy. Different models excel at detecting different types of manipulations, so combining them provides more robust detection.

### Two-Tier Fact-Checking

Our fact-checking system uses a two-tier approach:

1. Generate effective search queries based on the claim
2. Retrieve information from reliable sources and analyze it against the claim

This approach allows for more nuanced fact-checking than simple keyword matching, as it considers context and can identify partial truths or misleading statements.

### Browser Extension Integration

We chose a browser extension as the frontend because:

- It provides seamless integration with users' browsing experience
- It allows for contextual analysis without leaving the current page
- It can access and analyze content directly from the DOM

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dl-week-2025
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r fastapi-ai-agent/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_google_custom_search_engine_id
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
   ```

5. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```
   cd fastapi-ai-agent
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload
   ```
   The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Extension Setup

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` directory from the project
4. The extension should now be installed and visible in your browser toolbar

## Usage Guide

### Text Analysis

1. Select text on any webpage
2. Either:
   - Click on the magnifying glass icon that appears and select an analysis option, or
   - Right-click and select "Detect misinformed text" or "Fact check information"
3. View the analysis results in the overlay that appears

### Image Analysis

1. Right-click on any image on a webpage
2. Select "Detect deepfake" from the context menu
3. View the analysis results in the overlay that appears

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following endpoints:

- **POST /check-ai-generated/**: Checks if text is AI-generated

  - Request body: `{"text": "Text to analyze"}`
  - Response: `{"generated_score": 0.75}` (score between 0-1, higher means more likely AI-generated)

- **POST /fact-check/**: Checks the factual accuracy of a statement

  - Request body: `{"fact": "Fact to check"}`
  - Response: `{"result": "TRUE/FALSE/UNVERIFIABLE with explanation and sources"}`

- **POST /get_links/**: Gets relevant sources for a given text
  - Request body: `{"text": "Text to find sources for"}`
  - Response: `{"result": "List of sources with titles and URLs"}`

## Future Improvements

- Add support for video deepfake detection
- Implement user feedback mechanism to improve model accuracy
- Add more language support for non-English content
- Develop a dashboard for tracking misinformation trends
- Integrate with social media platforms for wider reach
